               <p class="tite1">WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</p>
               <p class="title2">This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information collected by KPVE via the website located at www.kpve.com.</p>

               <p class="title3">1. What is "personal information"?</p>
               <p class="title4">(a) The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) currently defines "personal information" as meaning
               information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably
               identifiable:</p>
               <p class="title5">   (i) whether the information or opinion is true or not; and</p>
               <p class="title5">   (ii) whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.</p>
               <p class="title4">(b) If the information does not disclose your identity or enable your identity to be ascertained,
               it will in most cases not be classified as "personal information" and will not be subject to
               this privacy policy.</p>
               
               <p class="title3">2. What information do we collect?</p>
               <p class="title4">(a) The kind of personal information that we collect from you will depend on how you use the
               website. The personal information which we collect and hold about you may include:
               Facebook username and password, credit card details, user ID for accessing our websites
               services & location information..</p>

               <p class="title3">3. How we collect your personal information</p>
               <p class="title4">(a) We may collect personal information from you whenever you input such information into the website.</p>
               <p class="title4">(b) We also collect cookies from your computer which enable us to tell when you use the
               website and also to help customise your website experience. As a general rule, however, it
               is not possible to identify you personally from our use of cookies.</p>

               <p class="title3">4. Purpose of collection</p>
               <p class="title4">(a) The purpose for which we collect personal information is to provide you with the best
               service experience possible on the website.</p>
               <p class="title4">(b) We customarily disclose personal information only to our service providers who assist us in
               operating the website. Your personal information may also be exposed from time to time to
               maintenance and support personnel acting in the normal course of their duties.</p>
               <p class="title4">(c) By using our website, you consent to the receipt of direct marketing material. We will only
               use your personal information for this purpose if we ha e collected such information direct
               from you, and if it is material of a type which you would reasonably expect to receive from
               use. In We do not use sensitive personal information in direct marketing activity. Our direct marketing material will include a simple means by which you can request not to receive
               further communications of this nature.</p>

               <p class="title3">5. Access and correction</p>
               <p class="title4"> Australian Privacy Principle 12 permits you to obtain access to the personal information we hold
               about you in certain circumstances, and Australian Privacy Principle 13 allows you to correct
               inaccurate personal information subject to certain exceptions. If you would like to obtain such
               access, please contact us as set out below.</p>

               <p class="title3">6. Complaint procedure</p>
               <p class="title4"> If you have a complaint concerning the manner in which we maintain the privacy of your personal
               information, please contact us as set out below. All complaints will be considered by KPVE and
               we may seek further information from you to clarify your concerns. If we agree that your
               complaint is well founded, we will, in consultation with you, take appropriate steps to rectify the
               problem. If you remain dissatisfied with the outcome, you may refer the matter to the Office of the
               Australian Information Commissioner.</p>

               <p class="title3">7. Overseas transfer</p>
               <p class="title4"> Your personal information may be transferred overseas or stored overseas for a variety of
               reasons. It is not possible to identify each and every country to which your personal information
               may be sent. If your personal information is sent to a recipient in a country with data protection
               laws which are at least substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles, and where there
               are mechanisms available to you to enforce protection of your personal information under that
               overseas law, we will not be liable for a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles if your
               personal information is mishandled in that jurisdiction. If your personal information is transferred
               to a jurisdiction which does not have data protection laws as comprehensive as Australia's, we
               will take reasonable steps to secure a contractual commitment from the recipient to handle your
               information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>

               <p class="title3">8. GDPR</p>
               <p class="title4"> In some circumstances, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
               provides additional protection to individuals located in Europe. The fact that you may be located
               in Europe does not, however, on its own entitle you to protection under the GDPR. Our website
               does not specifically target customers located in the European Union and we do not monitor the
               behaviour of individuals in the European Union, and accordingly the GDPR does not apply.</p>

               <p class="title3">9. How to contact us about privacy</p>
               <p class="title4"> If you have any queries, or if you seek access to your personal information, or if you have a
               complaint about our privacy practices, you can contact us through: admin@kpve.com.au.</p>
